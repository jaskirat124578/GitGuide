git clone
Creates a GIT repository copy from a remote source. Also adds the original location as a remote so you can fetch from it again and push to it if you have permissions. Example:

git clone git@github.com:user/test.git
git add
Adds files changes in your working directory to your index. Example:

1

git rm filename

1
2
git commit -m ‘committing added changes’
git commit -a -m ‘committing all changes, equals to git add and git commit’
git status
Shows you the status of files in the index versus the working directory. It will list out files that are untracked (only in your working directory), modified (tracked but not yet updated in your index), and staged (added to your index and ready for committing). Example:

3
